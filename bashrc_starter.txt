# A decent stack exchange on color codes: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/124407/what-color-codes-can-i-use-in-my-ps1-prompt
# Recommendation: define named variables, then use those variables

# one of many webpages with info about special PS1 codes: https://ss64.com/bash/syntax-prompt.html

# For example, this is the color reset code
RESET="\033[0m"
EXAMPLE_COLOR_REPLACE_ME="\033[01;32m\]"

    echo -ne "bam" # as an example, see how echoing text here changes your prompt

    # insert strings to test for in the if statements below
    # example of using an "and" (&&)
    # =~ means "contains"
    # ! means "not"
